# Breast-Cancer-Analysis-with-Python
Join me on a two-part journey as I dive into a data analysis project focused on breast cancer, a condition that has been recognized for centuriesâ€”dating back to ancient Egypt. Back then, breast cancer, referred to as "tumors" or "ulcers," was treated through cauterization, with significant impacts on women's lives.

In modern times, the incidence of breast cancer has increased by about 0.79% per year. This disease affects women in numerous ways, both personally and professionally, often taking a toll on their psychological, emotional, and physical well-being. Fortunately, early detection through screenings like mammograms has significantly improved treatment success rates.

I have analyzed a dataset on breast cancer, and I'm excited to share the insights I have uncovered.

Key Variables in the Dataset:
Clump Thickness
Uniformity of Cell Size
Uniformity of Cell Shape
Marginal Adhesion
Single Epithelial Cell Size
Bare Nuclei
Bland Chromatin
Normal Nucleoli
Mitoses

For classification: Class 2 indicates Benign (non-cancerous) cells, while Class 4 indicates Malignant (cancerous) cells.
